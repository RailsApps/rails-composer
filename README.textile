h1. !http://railsapps.github.io/images/rails-36x36.jpg(Rails Composer)! Rails Composer

An application template that creates a Rails 3.2 starter app.

It's the Rails generator on steroids. See the "Rails Composer project page":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer.

The Rails Composer application template is built from recipes provided by the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem. Need to customize the Rails Composer application template? Want to build your own application template? Use "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer.

If you're new to Rails, see "What is Ruby on Rails?":http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html,  recommendations for a "Rails tutorial":https://tutorials.railsapps.org/rails-tutorial, and a list of top resources for "Ruby and Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/ruby-and-rails.html.

h3. From the RailsApps Project

The "RailsApps project":http://railsapps.github.io/ provides example applications that developers use as starter apps. Hundreds of developers use the apps, report problems as they arise, and propose solutions. Rails changes frequently; each application is known to work and serves as your personal "reference implementation" so you can stay up to date. Each is accompanied by a tutorial so there is no mystery code. Maintenance and development of the RailsApps applications is supported by subscriptions to the "RailsApps tutorials":https://tutorials.railsapps.org.

Follow the project on Twitter: "@rails_apps":http://twitter.com/rails_apps. Please tweet some praise if you like what you've found.

h2. Dependencies

Before running the Rails Composer tool, you need to install:

* The Ruby language (version 2.0.0)
* Rails 3.2 or Rails 4.0

Check that appropriate versions of Ruby and Rails are installed in your development environment:
@$ ruby -v@
@$ rails -v@

Be sure to read "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html to make sure your development environment is set up properly.

h2. Creating a Starter App

To build a Rails application using the Rails Composer tool:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

Replace @myapp@ with the name of your application.

You can use the @-T@ flag to skip Test::Unit files or the @-O@ flag to skip Active Record files:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb -T -O
</pre>

Skip Test::Unit if you plan to use RSpec for unit testing. Skip Active Record if you plan to use a NoSQL datastore with an ORM such as Mongoid.

See the "Troubleshooting" section below if you see errors. In general, you'll avoid many problems if you create your application using RVM as described below.

h2. Creating a Starter App Using RVM

I recommend using "rvm":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, to manage your Rails versions, as described in the "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html article.

Here's how to generate a new Rails application using the Rails Composer tool and RVM:

<pre>
$ mkdir myapp
$ cd myapp
$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0@myapp --ruby-version --create
$ gem install rails
$ rails new . -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

You can add the @-T@ flag to skip Test::Unit files or the @-O@ flag to skip Active Record files. Skip Test::Unit if you plan to use RSpec for unit testing. Skip Active Record if you plan to use a NoSQL datastore with an ORM such as Mongoid.

Instead of installing Rails into the global gemset and running @rails new@, we'll create a root directory for a new application, create a new gemset, install Rails, and then generate a starter application.

When we create the gemset, the option "--ruby-version" creates *.ruby-version* and *.ruby-gemset* files in the root directory. RVM recognizes these files in an application's root directory and loads the required version of Ruby and the correct gemset whenever you enter the directory.

When we create the gemset, it will be empty (though it inherits use of all the gems in the global gemset). We immediately install Rails. The command @gem install rails@ installs the most recent stable release of Rails.

Finally we run @rails new .@. We use the Unix "dot" convention to refer to the current directory. This assigns the name of the directory to the new application.

This approach is different from the way most beginners are taught to create a Rails application. Our approach makes it easy to create a project-specific gemset to avoid clashes between gem versions when using the Rails Composer tool.

h2. Your Options

The Rails Composer application template will ask you for various preferences, some of which will depend on previous choices.

If you choose "I want to build my own application," you will get a full set of choices.

If you choose one of the RailsApps example applications, you will get fewer choices but you will get an exact copy of a known working example application. See "Rails example applications":http://railsapps.github.io/ for more information.

</pre>

h2. Run the Application

Switch to the application directory to examine and test what you've built.

<pre>
$ cd myapp
</pre>

h4. Quick Test

For a "smoke test" to see if everything runs, display a list of Rake tasks.

<pre>
$ rake -T
</pre>

There's no need to run @bundle exec rake@ instead of @rake@ when you are using rvm (see "rvm and bundler integration":https://rvm.io/integration/bundler/).

h4. Start the Web Server

If you've chosen WEBrick or Thin for your web server, can run the app by entering the command:

@$ rails server@

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000.

For the Unicorn web server:

@$ unicorn@

See the app at "http://localhost:8080/":http://localhost:8080.

For the Puma web server:

@$ rails server puma@

See the app at "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000.

h4. Login

If you've created a version of the application that sets up a default user, log in with:

* email: user@example.com
* password: changeme

You should delete or change any pre-configured logins before you deploy your application.

h2. Testing

Some versions of the starter application will contain a suite of RSpec unit tests or Cucumber scenarios and step definitions.

After installing the application, run @rake -T@ to check that rake tasks for RSpec and Cucumber are available.

Run @rake spec@ to run all RSpec tests.

Run @rake cucumber@ (or more simply, @cucumber@) to run all Cucumber scenarios.

Please send the author a message, create an issue, or submit a pull request if you want to contribute improved RSpec or Cucumber files.

h2. Deployment

For easy deployment, use a “platform as a service” provider such as:

* "Heroku":http://www.heroku.com/
* "CloudFoundry":http://www.cloudfoundry.com/
* "EngineYard":http://www.engineyard.com/
* "OpenShift":https://openshift.redhat.com/app/

For deployment on Heroku, see the article:

* "Rails on Heroku":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-heroku-tutorial.html

h2. Troubleshooting

Problems? Please check both "issues for the Rails Composer tool":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/issues and the "issues for the rails_apps_composer gem":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer/issues.

You should review the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html to make sure you've updated all the components that are required to run Rails successfully.

h4. Problems with "Could not be loaded... You have already activated..."

If you get an error like this:

<pre>
Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
    composer  Running 'after bundler' callbacks.
The template [...] could not be loaded.
Error: You have already activated ..., but your Gemfile requires ....
Using bundle exec may solve this.
</pre>

It's due to conflicting gem versions. See the article "Rails Error: “You have already activated (…)”":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-error-you-have-already-activated.html.

h4. Problems with "Certificate Verify Failed"

Are you getting an error "OpenSSL certificate verify failed" when you try to generate a new Rails app from an application template? See suggestions to resolve the error "Certificate Verify Failed":http://railsapps.github.io/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html.

h4. Problems with "Segmentation Fault"

If you get a "segfault" when you try @rails new@, try removing and reinstalling rvm.

h2. Application Template Default

The @rails new@ command creates a new Rails application. If you want to use the Rails Composer application template for every Rails application you build, you can set options for the @rails new@ command in a *.railsrc* file in your home directory. Here's how to set up a *.railsrc* file to use the template when you create a new Rails application:

<pre>
# ~/.railsrc
-m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

h2. Documentation and Support

The Rails Composer application template is assembled from recipes supplied by the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem. See the rails_apps_composer project to understand how the Rails Composer application works.

h4. Customizing the Template

If you wish to change the template to generate an app with your own customized options, you can copy and edit the template file. However, it is better to use the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem to create a new application template. You'll find newer versions of the recipes that make up the application template. You may find issues have been identified and (perhaps) fixed. And it will be easier to maintain your application template if you work from the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem.

h4. Writing Recipes

To understand the code in these templates, take a look at "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions. Your recipes can use any methods provided by "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions or "Rails::Generators::Actions":http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v3.0.3/classes/Rails/Generators/Actions.html. A big thanks to Yehuda Katz for "creating Thor":http://yehudakatz.com/2008/05/12/by-thors-hammer/.
